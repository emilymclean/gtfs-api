        Sinatra is a companion app for the Canberra MyWay+ network made by locals for locals. Our goal is to make it easier to find route and stop information, offering a fresh, streamlined experience alongside the official app.

        While Sinatra doesn't include ticketing or full routing features, we focus on delivering the key info you need, fast and frustration-free.

        Sinatra is open source! You can find and contribute to our codebase at [Github](https://github.com/emilymclean/sinatra).
